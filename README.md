# FooChoi Web Application
A full stack web app with user authentication login and CRUD functionality that allows users to submit their allergies, choose the type of cuisine they wish to cook, and get suggested food plates they can cook. This web application keeps saved all of allergies entered by users using MongoDb database. This app also allows you to save recipes and rate the recipe.

## Usage

1. Navigate to `localhost:9000`

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, MongoDb

The project focused on creating client side and server side JavaScript, CSS for styling, and an EJS template to render the html page. This project also used express for building the server API and MongoDb database to store the collections and documents containing the data from the allergies the user selected and the recipes that the user can prepare.

## Optimizations

For future updates I would customize further styling of the page for different individual users profile pages. In addition, I would want to connect this app with menu items at restaurants.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that this project has an interesting mix of both CRUD App functionality and user authentication login. In addition, I learned to work with authentication login capabilities for full stack web applications.

# Travel App - City Reviewer
A full stack web app with user authentication login and CRUD functionality that allows travelers to create a profile and contribute reviews on any city in the world they have visited. This web application keeps track of all of the reviews posted by users using mongodb database. This app also allows you to thumbs up or thumbs down individual reviews.

## Usage

1. Navigate to `localhost:9000`

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, Mongodb

The project focused on creating client side and server side JavaScript, CSS for styling, and an EJS template to render the html page. This project also used express for building the server API and mongodb database to store the collections and documents containing the data from the interactions with users regarding the cities they have visited and their reviews.

## Optimizations

For future updates I would customize further styling of the page for different individual users profile pages. In addition, I would consider to look into further using passport.js to customize the login credentials with Facebook and Google login. I would also customize the app to include pictures in a users profile page and a recommended city button for further optimization.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that this project has an interesting mix of both CRUD App functionality and user authentication login. In addition, I learned to work with authentication login capabilities for full stack web applications.
